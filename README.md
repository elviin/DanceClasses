# A guide for dance teachers on how to manage dance classes

### Scheduling 
1. Start the lesson on time. This is especially important when the lesson is part of a festival lineup with short breaks, or even no breaks at all between classes.
2. Require breaks between the lessons from the festival organizers. Some just avoid breaks in the festival program in order to rent the dance venue for lower costs or fit more lessons in the lineup. 15 minutes between the lessons should be enough for the students to get ready for the next dose of great moves. 
3. End the lesson on time. Finishing the choreography you were working hard on, shooting the videos and promoting yourself for the next festival you are going to teach in should all be done within the time slot of your lesson. Another lesson in a different room could have already started and your students should not miss the essential basics from their next class.

### Class formations
1. Organize the formation of your students right from the beginning of the class. A crowd is great for an engaging discussion. A different arrangement should, however, be adopted for teaching dancing figures. 
2. Leaders should change their positions in most cases as they need to see the teacher, and some of them do not stand in a good spot (behind a column, in a corner, behind other students). Obviously, if the figures for the followers are more complex or difficult, then, in that case, it would be better if the followers changed their positions.
3. Those students who are not willing to swap their partner should stay at the edge of the class formation. If they decide to make this choice, they should not be entitled to occupy nice spots right in front of the teachers, as the other leaders and followers would also like to turn to see well when they move around. The teachers should strive to give a fair share of their skills to everyone.
4. Instruct your students to swap the partner after a short time. Especially when explaining a figure from the very start of the lesson, it is always useful to make frequent changes. Try twice and then ask them to swap partners. If some students are not able to understand the move with one partner, another one could give them a piece of good advice, that could help a lot.  See the point 3.
5. Change your orientation frequently so that all students can see your leading or following from their limited point of view.
6. Change the spot in the class, dive in the crowd, go among the students to show the move. If there are two stages in a bigger hall, use that as an opportunity, and swap frequently between these stages.
7. Do not allow the students with privileged spots to cover the view entirely for the students who are at the edge of the formation. Always check that all students can view a fair portion of your class.


### Song tempo
1. It is a good choice to select a slower song at the beginning of the class, and then later increase the tempo, with different songs. Especially in case of more sensual figures it is difficult for the students to master the moves if the songs have a faster tempo.  It is important to fixate well the technique from the very start of the class, and with the faster tempo it is even more difficult, especially at the time when students first encounter your cool figure.
2. If your choreo fits so well with a song, play this song also during the lesson, not just for your demo.
3. Sometimes it is fun to practice the figures on a song which is not the right style, but the beats match the choreography.


### Communication
1. Smile.
2. Use whatever communication tool you want: smile, body language, combination of languages. If the students have fun, and can reproduce your figures, then you should not be woried about your language skills at all.
3. Speak loudly so those guys and girls at the back of the formation can hear you. 
4. Clearly split the choreo parts. You can start with a rough form of the combination and increase its complexity steadilly during the class.
5. When you are going to start a move, always start counting with 5, 6, 7, 8, so that the students can get ready.
6. If you do not have their attention, try to figure out first, why everyone is talking. Maybe there is dark corner in your teaching and the students are confused.
7. Ask the students at the biginning of the class, what is their favourite langue. You can always switch between the languages during the class.
8. Respect yourself and others. When your amazing figure is being questioned, it is always a good sign that your students are engaged, or the figure is a bit more complex. Do not ridicule the students for that, or make fun of them. If they are interested, explain the figure or the move from a different point of view. 


### Figures
1. It is more fun when your students can reproduce the figures in the next party. 
2. More complexity, styling and tricks can be added towards the end of the workshop.
3. If you are not able to lead your figure with a random follower, consider to simplify the figure. See the point 2.
4. Give students enough time to repeat the figures.
5. This point is similar to the point 2, but consider also teaching alternative figures. 


If everything goes wrong, still try to have fun.
